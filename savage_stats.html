                <br>When players have finished the MSQ, spent all their gil at the casino,<br>fished all the fish in the sea... what better is there to do than <dfn>raid</dfn>?
                <br>But, what even is <dfn>raiding</dfn>?  <img src="assets/alert.png" width="25px" height="25px">

                <br><dfn>Raiding</dfn> generally refers to endgame content. After completing the Main Story Quests, players can unlock the <dfn>raids</dfn> for that expansion, and in turn, unlock 
                the <dfn>savage</dfn> difficulty of them after clearing the raids' at normal difficulty.
                <br>Additionally, every few patches, a new <dfn>Ultimate raid</dfn> is released. <dfn>Ultimate raids</dfn> 
                have the most complicated mechanics in the game, and often requires party members to verbally communicate and be exceptionally coordinated to succeed. The act of making <dfn>progress</dfn> (progging) 
                and playing these Ultimate and Savage raids is called <dfn>raiding</dfn>.

                Courtesy of my friend, the above is a recording of The Weapon's Refrain,<br>an Ultimate raid part of the <i>Stormblood</i> expansion.

            <br>

            <p>
                Given the difficulty of raiding, from the intricate mechanics to the strict DPS requirements, there are often <i>"preferred"</i> Jobs and party setups. Many teamp compositions 
                will prefer Jobs that have a higher damage potential or exceptional utility, but which Jobs do the most damage? I gathered data about the top damage dealers for four 
                Savage raids in the <dfn>Pandaemonium</dfn> series. I used <a href="https://www.fflogs.com/">FFlogs</a>, a site to upload raid battle data for combat analysis, to get this information.
                <br>
                <br>The chart is based on <dfn>rDPS</dfn>, a DPS measurement that accounts for the buffs some Jobs can give.
                In other words, <b>a player's rDPS consists of their DPS excluding the damage gained from others' buffs, including 
                the damage the player gave to others through their buffs</b>. It best shows how much damage was <i>contributed</i> by a player.
                Further explanation can be found at this <a href="https://www.fflogs.com/help/rdps">FFLogs page</a>.

            <p>
                From the chart, it is clear that <dfn>Melee</dfn> Jobs have the highest average damage. <dfn>Dragoon</dfn> is a straightforward in 
                playstyle and is relatively strong, with some DRG outliers dealing the most damage overall. <dfn>Monk</dfn> is consistent in dealing high damage,
                 but is fast-paced and may be difficult to master (and reach the high damage ceiling MNK has). The <dfn>Physical Ranged</dfn> and <dfn>Caster</dfn> 
                 Jobs perform adequately. An interesting point is <dfn>Dancer</dfn>, whose upper damage range is quite high. This is likely due to 
                 the playstyle of the Dancer Job: it revolves around <dfn>buffing</dfn> ally damage. Therefore, if a player's party members are already doing high damage,
                 with the rDPS calculation, the buffs Dancer grants will significantly boost their own rDPS.
            </p>

            <br>

            <p>
                In North American Worlds, the distribution of Jobs (as explored in the <a href="jobs.html">previous page</a>) is relatively even.
                Then, in a vaccuum, it would make sense that all Worlds are equally active in the <dfn>raiding</dfn> scene; is this true?
                <br>
                The below chart displays the percentage of players who have cleared <dfn>Abyssos: The Eighth Circle (Savage)</dfn> (P8S), the final raid battle 
                for the second section of Pandaemonium, by World. The percentage is calculated by dividing the number of people who have cleared by the total number 
                of active players in that World.

            <p>
                There is a clear difference in P8S clear rates across Data Centers.
                <dfn>Aether</dfn> Worlds have the highest clear rates, followed by <dfn>Primal</dfn>, then <dfn>Crystal</dfn> 
                and <dfn>Dynamis</dfn>. As seen on the <a href="World_Population.html">Populations</a> page, the only significantly small 
                Data Center is the newly added Dynamis.
                <br>Therefore, the notion that <dfn>Crystal</dfn> is more of a <dfn>casual</dfn> Data Center 
                seems true. <dfn>Crystal</dfn>, despite being the same size (or slightly larger) than <dfn>Aether</dfn> and <dfn>Primal</dfn>, has the 
                has similar clear rates to <dfn>Dynamis</dfn>, a new and small Data Center. Because player numbers do not seem to be affecting 
                this rate, it can be assumed that <dfn>Crystal</dfn> is indeed a more <dfn>casual</dfn> Data Center and places less emphasis on <dfn>raiding</dfn>.
