           <b>✧ <u>What Jobs are Most Popular?</u> ✧</b>

    <body>

            <p>
                There are 21 unique <dfn>Jobs</dfn> in FFXIV, each with different playstyles and specialties. Are there certain jobs that are more popular across worlds?
                Or are there are any differences in Job distribution between <dfn>"hardcore"</dfn> and <dfn>casual"</dfn>" worlds? The below stacked-bar chart shows the distribution of Jobs across Worlds.
                <br>
                The dropdown menu on the right can be used to filter what Worlds or Data Centers are shown.

                Overall, it appears that though there are general trends of popular Jobs throughout the North American Data Centers, there does not appear to be much different <i>between</i> Data Centers or Worlds.
                In other words, both <dfn>hardcore</dfn> and <dfn>casual</dfn> communities seem to favor the same Jobs. There may be a inter-region difference (e.g. between North America and Japan), and I would like to look into that in a future iteration.
                <br>
                <br>In North American worlds, the most consistently <b>popular</b> Jobs are <dfn>Samurai</dfn>, <dfn>Dark Knight</dfn>, and <dfn>Scholar/Summoner</dfn>.
                Samurai is flashy, has beautiful animations, and (in my opinion) a very fun playstyle. Though I was still surprised by its popularity;
                players must have purchased the Stormblood expansion to unlock the Job. Dragoon, a Job that can be unlocked for free, is comparable in style,
                so I was surprised to see that Dragoon is not the most popular DPS. Dark Knight's popularity is expected. DRK's Job Story Questline
                is largely regarded as the best in the game, and a recent expansion (Shadowbringers) gave DRK a spotlight. Scholar and Summoner may be popular due
                to their convenience. Wait times to get into game content (like dungeons or raids) are <i>much</i> shorter for healers and tanks because 
                not as many people play them; most play DPS. So, by playing Summoner/Scholar, a player has the ability to stay in a familiar
                DPS job (SMN) while being able to opt for faster queue times as a healer (SCH).

            <br>
            <p>
                The data show that in North America, <b>DPS Job players are more common than Tank or Healer players</b>.
                Of all Jobs unlocked by active players, 57.9% are DPS, 21.3% are Tank, and 20.8% are Healer. This distribution 
                matches what I imagined. It may because there seems to be less pressure when playing as a DPS compared to
                playing as a Tank or Healer. <dfn>Tanks</dfn> are what lead the party into battle, and must ensure that all possible mobs are 
                focused on them rather than their party members. <dfn>Healers</dfn>, as the name suggests, balance helping the team damage enemies while 
                keeping their own teammates alive. The main role of a <dfn>DPS</dfn> is to do damage, a task the other two roles also try to fulfill. Though, the core skill rotation of a DPS Job tends
                to be more complicated compared to Healers (and sometimes Tanks).
                <br>
                <br>In addition, in <dfn>dungeon</dfn> content, parties are made up of <b>1 Tank, 1 Healer, and 2 DPS</b>. <dfn>Raids and trials</dfn> consist of <b>2 Tanks, 2 Healers, and 4 DPS</b>.
                Given that there are always more DPS than the other two roles, there <i>feels</i> to be more pressure on Tanks and Healers to balance their 
                unique tasks along with helping the DPS attack the enemy.
                <br>
                <br>In regards to <dfn>DPS subrole</dfn> popularity, I'm surprised to see that <dfn>Melee</dfn> Jobs are most popular. <dfn>Physical Ranged</dfn> Jobs are considered to be the easiest; they are mobile, so it easier to 
                complete fight mechanics smoothly compared to Melee Jobs that have to stay close to the enemy. <dfn>Casters</dfn> are in a position I expected. They are the least mobile subrole of the DPS role, and though 
                they are capable of <dfn>high DPS</dfn> and/or <dfn>utility</dfn>, they may be more difficult to play.
                However, the Melee subrole has the highest quantity of Jobs, so perhaps there is more a appealing variety 
                to choose from.
